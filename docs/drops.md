# Loot Drops
Loot drops are made to encourage players to venture to the centre of the map and collect loot to aide their quest for victory. Loot tables will be used to generate a chest above the ground at y:150 then breaks it to spread the loot and create a timer using the natural despawn rate of items. There will be a starter drop with useful items at the beginning of a game. Throughout the game there will be general loot drops. Please see gamemodes for details on loot drop timings.

Name dictates the name of the table to be referenced in the pack. Global quantity is the range dictating the amount of items that will spawn. Bonus has to do with luck and can alter the contents of the chest. Usually left at 0 due to chets not being opened, but instead broken.

Item weight will be out of a total of 100.
